# Supervised-Learning-Project

Project/Goals
The goal is to create a machine learning model that can make connections between diabetes risk factors and a diagnosis.

## Process

---
1. Exploratory Data Analysis.

-Are there any missing values in the dataset?
Fortunately, there are not any missing values in the dataset.

- How are the predictor variables related to the outcome variable?

- What is the average age of the individuals in the dataset?

The average age is 33.

-What is the average BMI with and without diabetes?

Average age is 35 with diabetes

Average age is 30 without diabetes

## Results

---
Two machine learning models were trained:

Random Forest Model:

SVM Model:

We could go either way when it comes to selecting which model to use for diabetes diagnosis.
If we choose the Random Forest Model we are more likey to catch all true positive cases.

If we choose SVM we would be more resevered when it comes to deciding whether someone has diabetes.


## Challenges

---
The short time span of the project was an interesting challenge.
Condensing the information into a powerpoint was sligtly challenging.

## Future Goals

---
If I had more time I would train more machine learning models to see if I can find an optimal one for the problem being solved here.
