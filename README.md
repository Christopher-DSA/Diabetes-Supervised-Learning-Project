# Supervised-Learning-Project

Project/Goals
The goal is to create a machine learning model that can make connections between diabetes risk factors and a diagnosis.

## Process
1. Exploratory Data Analysis.

-Are there any missing values in the dataset?
Fortunately, there are not any missing values in the dataset.

- How are the predictor variables related to the outcome variable?

- What is the average age of the individuals in the dataset?

The average age is 33.

-What is the average BMI with and without diabetes?

Results
I chose option 1: Standard Final Project.

Data Sources I used. Weekly earnings from 1.1.2001 to 15.4.2015 (weekly_earnings - CSV) Housing constructions from 1955 to 2019 (real_estate_numbers - CSV) House prices from 1.1.2005 to 1.9.2020 (real_estate_prices - EXCEL) Housing_price_index from November 1979 to September 2020 Office_realestate_index from November 1979 to September 2020 Consumer index from November 1979 to September 2020

Business context: People are spending more money than ever, now is a good time to be a merchant. Houses are more valuable than ever and the trend suggests this will continue, buying real estate at this time is favorable investment.

Challenges
Trying to import the json file into tableau was tricky, however I was able to use Python and the json library to clean the data and get it ready for analysis.

Limited domain knowledge at the start of the project, learned more as I did research on real estate terminologies.

Future Goals
If I had more time I would try and do one of the other non standard final projects, some of those topics interest me and I believe that curiosty would help me take my analysis skills to a new level.
